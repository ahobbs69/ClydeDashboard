**Red Flags:**
- Prices too good to be true (50%+ below retail = likely fake)
- Sellers with no/little feedback
- Inconsistent batch codes
- Missing original box (common for used, but watch for "no box" as cover)

**Best Practices for Resellers:**
- Buy from authorized retailers (Sephora, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Saks)
- Keep receipts/proof of purchase
- Take photos of serial numbers before shipping
- Sell with original packaging when possible

### Actionable Recommendations

**For Tom Ford Reselling:**
- ✅ Focus on 100ml sizes (best value-per-ml, highest demand)
- ✅ Target fall/winter for Tobacco Vanille, Oud Wood
- ✅ Spring/summer: Lost Cherry, Soleil Blanc move faster
- ✅ Build reputation on r/fragranceswap before scaling to eBay
- ✅ Consider decanting for higher margins (5-10ml = $15-30, very low cost basis)
- ⚠️ Avoid heavily discounted "sealed" bottles on unauthorized marketplaces
