# Passive Income Research: Real Estate & REITs

## Executive Summary

Real estate offers multiple paths to passive income, each with different capital requirements, risk profiles, and time commitments. This guide covers traditional investing, REITs, and fractional platforms with specific recommendations based on starting capital.

---

## 1. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)

### What Are REITs?
REITs are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate. They must distribute 90%+ of taxable income as dividends, making them high-yielding passive investments.

### Types of REITs
- **Equity REITs** (most common): Own and operate properties, earn through rent
- **Mortgage REITs (mREITs)**: Finance real estate, earn interest income
- **Hybrid REITs**: Combination of both

### Top REITs for Passive Income (2025-2026)

| REIT | Ticker | Sector | Approx Yield | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Realty Income | O | Retail | 5.2-5.8% | "Monthly Dividend Company," 60+ years of dividend increases |
| STORE Capital | STOR | Single-tenant commercial | 5.0-5.5% | Triple-net leases, growth focused |
| Vanguard Real Estate | VNQ (ETF) | Diversified | 3.5-4.2% | ETF, very liquid, low expense ratio (0.12%) |
| Essex Property Trust | ESS | Apartments (West Coast) | 3.2-3.8% | High-quality markets |
| Alexandria Real Estate | ARE | Life sciences offices | 4.0-4.5% | Niche tech/healthcare |

### How to Buy REITs
1. Open a brokerage account (Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Robinhood)
2. Search ticker symbol
3. Buy shares (can start with as little as $10-50 for some)

### REITs vs Physical Property

| Factor | REITs | Physical Property |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Liquidity | High (sell daily) | Low (months to sell) |
| Capital needed | $500-$5,000 | $20,000-$100,000+ |
| Management | Fully passive | Active or hire PM |
| Tax treatment | Ordinary income | Depreciation benefits |
| Control | None | Full control |
| Leverage | Built-in | Can leverage further |
| Returns | 7-12% avg historically | 8-15% with effort |

### Risk Factors
- Interest rate sensitivity (rates up = REIT prices down typically)
- Economic downturns reduce occupancy/rent
- Some sectors (retail, office) face structural challenges
- Non-traded REITs have liquidity risk

## 2. Traditional Real Estate Strategies

### House Hacking
**What it is:** Live in one unit, rent out others (duplex, triplex, 4-unit, or single family with ADU)

**Strategies:**
- **Live-in flip**: Buy distressed, live in while renovating, refinance, repeat
- **Room rental**: Rent bedrooms in your primary residence
- **ADU/Granny flat**: Rent separate unit on property

**Best for:** Beginners wanting to live for free + build equity

**ROI:** Can achieve 20-50%+ cash-on-cash return in first year

---

### BRRRR Method
**Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat**

1. **Buy** distressed property below market value
2. **Rehab** to add value
3. **Rent** for cash flow
4. **Refinance** (cash-out) based on new ARV
5. **Repeat** with freed-up capital

**Requirements:**
- Good credit (680+)
- Ability to fund rehab (hard money or private money)
- Experience with renovations
- 6-12 months per cycle

**Risk:** Stuck with property if can't refinance/rent

---

### Cash Flow Analysis for Rentals

**Key Metrics:**

```
Gross Rental Income
- Vacancy (5-10%)
- Property Management (8-12%)
- Maintenance (5-10%)
- Insurance
- Property Taxes
- HOA (if applicable)
= Net Operating Income (NOI)

NOI - Mortgage Payment = Cash Flow
```

**Target:** $200-400+ monthly cash flow per unit minimum

**Rule of Thumb:**
- 1% Rule: Monthly rent ≥ 1% of purchase price (rare in 2025)
- 50% Rule: Assume 50% goes to expenses
- Cash-on-Cash Return: Annual cash flow ÷ total cash invested

---

### Property Management: Hire vs Self-Manage

| Factor | Self-Manage | Hire PM |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Cost | $0 | 8-12% of rent |
| Time | 5-15 hrs/month | 1-2 hrs/month |
| Quality | Variable | Professional |
| Best for | <3 properties, local | >3 properties, out of state |

**What PMs do:** Tenant screening, rent collection, maintenance, evictions, reporting

---

### Financing Options

| Type | Down Payment | Credit | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Conventional** | 20-25% | 620+ | Best rates, PMI if <20% |
| **FHA** | 3.5% | 580+ | MIP required, owner-occupied |
| **BRRRR/Hard Money** | 10-25% | 600+ | Short-term (6-12 mo), 10-15% interest |
| **Private Money** | Negotiable | Flexible | Friends/family/investors, 8-12% |
| **HELOC** | N/A | 680+ | Use home equity to buy rentals |

### Landlord Laws & Responsibilities
- Fair Housing Act compliance (no discrimination)
- Security deposit limits (varies by state)
- Habitability requirements
 lease- Proper agreements
- Eviction procedures (legal process only)
- Tax deductions (depreciation, expenses, 1031 exchanges)
