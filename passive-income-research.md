## 5. PASSIVE CRYPTO

### Staking Rewards

- Rocket Pool (decentralized)
- Staking via Coinbase/Binance

### Lending (DeFi)

**Platforms:**
- **Aave**: 3-8% on deposits, variable
- **Compound**: 3-6% on deposits
- **Nexo**: 5-12% (centralized, higher rates)

**Risks:**

- Impermanent loss
- Crypto volatility
- Regulatory uncertainty

### DAO Investing

**What:** Decentralized Autonomous Organizations for collective investment

**Legit DAOs to research:**

- LAO (angel investing)
- Dream DAO (social impact)

**Risks:** High risk, often no regulatory protection, many scams

### Token Dividends

**Some tokens pay holders:**
- CEX tokens (BNB, OKB, HT) - discount on fees
- DeFi tokens - governance + rewards
- Staking tokens - network rewards

### Startup Cost
- Minimum: $100-500 to start
- Recommended: $1,000-10,000 for meaningful returns

### Time Investment
- Research: 5-10 hours initially
- Ongoing: 1-2 hrs/week monitoring
- Mostly passive once set up

### Profit Potential
- Conservative: 5-15% APY
- Aggressive (yield farming): 20-100% APY (EXTREME RISK)
- Realistic annual return: 5-10% (with proper risk management)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNINGS
- Crypto is HIGHLY volatile - only invest what you can afford to lose
- DeFi = smart contract risk = potential total loss
- No FDIC insurance
- Tax implications (consult a professional)
- Many "guaranteed" returns are scams

**Best Next Step**: If interested in crypto passive income:
1. Start with staking ETH via Lido (lowest risk entry)
2. Use only 5-10% of any "investment" money
3. Never invest more than you can afford to lose entirely
4. Research extensively before using any DeFi protocol
