## iOS Development Learnings

- Installed iOS, xcode, and ios-simulator skills from clawhub
- **iOS Build Issue**: App built for simulator can't run on physical device (different architecture)
- **SwiftUI fixes**: 
  - Use `Color(UIColor.systemGroupedBackground)` for proper background
  - Avoid implicit `.systemBackground` without type context
  - GeometryReader helps with responsive layouts
- Physical iPhone deployment requires proper code signing (not just simulator build)

## Installed Skills
- ios (iOS development best practices)
- ios-simulator (simulator automation)
- xcode (Xcode tips & tricks)

## iOS App Status
- ClydeDashboard built successfully for simulator
- Need to build for physical device to push to Andrew's iPhone 17 Pro Max
- Connected device: Andrew's iPhone 17 (8CFFFADA-CA05-574B-BA3B-12B7DF2E243F)

## Previous Context
- Fragrance resale research (Dior Sauvage, Chanel, YSL Libre = best ROI)
- Gainium paper trading bots running
- Tailscale blocked (funnel not enabled on tailnet)
