## 📺 YOUTUBE / VIDEO

### How YouTube Ad Revenue Works (CPM vs RPM)

**Key Metrics:**
- **CPM (Cost Per Mille)**: What advertisers pay per 1,000 ad impressions. Average CPMs range from $1-15 depending on niche.
- **RPM (Revenue Per Mille)**: What YOU earn per 1,000 views. Typically 45-55% of CPM (YouTube takes ~45-55% cut).
- **Average creator RPM**: $1-5 per 1,000 views (very niche-dependent)

**Real Numbers:**
- 100,000 views/month ≈ $50-500/month (general niche)
- 100,000 views/month ≈ $300-1,500/month (high-paying niche: finance, business, tech)
- 1M views/month ≈ $500-5,000+/month

**Factors Affecting Revenue:**
1. Niche (finance pays 10-20x more than entertainment)
2. Audience location (US/UK/Canada = highest CPMs)
3. Content length (longer videos = more ads = higher RPM)
4. Seasonality (Q4 = highest ad rates)

### Niche Selection for Fastest Growth + High CPM

**Top Tier ($5-15+ RPM):**
- Personal finance / investing
- Business / entrepreneurship  
- Software tutorials / SaaS
- Real estate
- Health / fitness (high competition)

**Mid Tier ($2-5 RPM):**
- Tech reviews / gadgets
- Career advice / productivity
- DIY / home improvement
- Cooking / food

**Lower Tier ($0.50-2 RPM):**
- Gaming
- Vlogs / lifestyle
- Music / entertainment
- Kids content

**Growth Speed vs. Revenue Trade-off:**
- Finance: Slowest growth, highest revenue
- Gaming/Entertainment: Fastest growth, lowest revenue
- Tutorial/how-to: Balanced (good growth + decent revenue)

---

### Evergreen vs. Trending Content

| Aspect | Evergreen | Trending |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Views over time | Consistent for years | Spikes then drops |
| Search traffic | Yes (SEO) | No |
| Effort to maintain | Low | High (constant new content) |
| Best for | Passive income | Building audience fast |

**Recommendation for Passive Income:** Evergreen content is king. Tutorials, reviews, guides, and educational content continue generating views and revenue years after publication.

---

### YouTube Shorts Monetization (2025-2026)

**Current Requirements:**
- 1,000 subscribers + 10M views (90 days) OR
- 4,000 watch hours (standard program)

**Revenue:**
- Creator Pool: Shorts ads generate revenue into a pool, distributed to creators based on views (not full ad revenue)
- Typical rate: $0.01-0.06 per view (much lower than long-form)
- Most creators earn 10-20% of what long-form generates

**Strategic Use:**
- Shorts for discovery → long-form for revenue
- Use Shorts to funnel to evergreen long-form videos

---

### Affiliate Links in YouTube Descriptions

**How It Works:**
- Add links in first 48 hours (before algorithm hides them)
- Use redirect/tracking links (Bitly, Genius Links)
- Disclose affiliate relationships

**Best Performing Niches:**
- Tech/gadgets (Amazon Associates)
- Tools/software (SaaS affiliate programs)
- Books (Amazon)
- Courses/education

**Typical Earnings:**
- Amazon: 1-10% commission
- Software: 20-50% recurring commission
- Average YouTuber: 5-15% of total revenue from affiliates

---

### Timeline to Meaningful YouTube Income

| Stage | Time | Monthly Income |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Building audience | 0-12 months | $0 |
| Monetization start | 12-18 months | $0-100 |
| Growth phase | 18-36 months | $100-1,000 |
| Scale phase | 36+ months | $1,000-10,000+ |

**Realistic Expectation:** Most YouTubers never make meaningful money. Top 1% of channels (10K+ subscribers) earn ~$500/month median. Top 0.1% (100K+ subscribers) earn ~$5,000/month median.

---

### WordPress vs Substack vs Medium

| Platform | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **WordPress** | Full control, SEO, monetization | Hosting/maintenance needed | Serious bloggers, long-term |
| **Substack** | Built-in audience, email list, easy | Limited design, 10% fee | Newsletter-focused, writers |
| **Medium** | Built-in audience, easy | Low monetization, no email list | Testing ideas, reach |

**Recommendation for Passive Income:**
- **WordPress self-hosted** = Full control, best SEO, no platform risk
