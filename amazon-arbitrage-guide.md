# Amazon Arbitrage & Reselling Guide for Andrew (San Diego)

## 1. AMAZON ARBITRAGE BEST PRACTICES

### How It Works
You buy products from retail stores at discount/clearance prices, then resell them on Amazon for a profit. The key is finding items where retail price < Amazon price, typically through:
- Clearance sections
- End-of-season sales
- Mispriced items
- Regional products unavailable elsewhere

### Golden Rules
- **Minimum $3 profit per item** (good starting threshold)
- **50% ROI minimum** after fees, shipping, and taxes
- **Sales rank below 250,000** in category for bestsellers
- Only buy what you can verify sells on Amazon first (scan first!)
