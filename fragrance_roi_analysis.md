## KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Niche fragrances dominate**: Kilian, Bond No.9, Le Labo, Xerjoff, Initio offer highest ROI
2. **Creed family strong**: Aventus, Millesime Imperial, Himalaya all show 120%+ ROI
3. **Avoid mass market**: Versace Eros, 1 Million, typical designers offer only 40-60% ROI
4. **Elixir versions outperform**: Sauvage Elixir, Le Male Elixir, Bad Boy Elixir command premiums
5. **Chanel/Lancôme limited upside**: Despite high retail, resale margins are modest
